# A Simple Weather App

This is a frontend weather app for a technical assessment. The brief is to create a simple weather application with the following requirements:

- The application should be responsive.
- The tech stack should include React and Typescript (this project was generated using `create-react-app`).
- The data should come from either OpenWeather or IBM (this project uses OpenWeather).
